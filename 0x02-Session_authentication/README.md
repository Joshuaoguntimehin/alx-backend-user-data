R: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
flask 3.0.3 requires Werkzeug>=3.0.0, but you have werkzeug 0.16.1 which is incompatible.
Successfully installed werkzeug-0.16.1
